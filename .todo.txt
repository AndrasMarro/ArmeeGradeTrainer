- todolist/ideas:

game / "lernmodus":
- some grades appear twice
- infinite game, but maybe add a finish button for a overview of the run
    -> mode=passplay-results make viable for "lernmodus" and test mode
    -> mode=results

pass&play:
- fix the pass&play aspect, change player after each question
- fix winning player if everyone wins

test mode:
- mode where skills are tested, goes through every grade once and gives a review like pass&play

misc:
- global language support, not just grades and categories
